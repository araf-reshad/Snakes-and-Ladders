## Sources

### Reminders

* In this course, getting help from online sources is okay as long as you cite them and indicate which lines of code you copied.
* In this course, getting help from other people is okay as long as you are not copy/pasting their code and you are doing all the typing.
* It is considered cheating if you copy code from your peers or get someone to do all the work for you.
* Each project file has a file history that can be used to easily determine excessive copy/pasting.
* Lying about your sources (e.g. saying you didn't get help when you actually did) can lead to disciplinary actions.
