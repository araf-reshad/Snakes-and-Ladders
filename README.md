## **Project #2: Human vs. Bot Game**
**Goal:** Create a two-player game (a user against a computer) in which the user interacts with the console *or* with a Turtle window. The computer can either play/make moves at random or incorporate some sort of strategy.

### **Step 1: Choose a game.**

Some suggestions looked into:
* [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)
* [Dot and Boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes)
* [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))
* [Farkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle)
* [Math problem solving game](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vEsXHTvMq4tSr3h6YQWwYdRdJD8EJseD_WfN2knJjh4/edit?usp=sharing)

### **Step 2: Plan the game.**

Answered the following questions.

1. How does my game work?
2. How long do I think it will take to write all the code for this game?
3. What do I think will be the most challenging part of creating this game?
4. If I happen to finish early, what other features could I try to add to the game to make it better?

### **Step 3: Begin coding the game.**

Wanted to ensure that my program has line comments to explain my thinking and that the code includes ALL of the following. Wanted to showcase my skills by making the code readable, concise, and functioning. 

* `print()`
* `input()`
* `if`
* `def`
* a global variable
* a loop
* a list or a tuple
* a method involving a list, string, or some other object

Whenever you use `def` to make a custom function, be sure to document it using a docstring.

### **Step 4: Test the game.**

Asked these prompts to peers to get feedback on the overall playability and user interface of the game. 

* What parts of the program/game were done well?
* What parts of the program/game could use improvement?
* What do you wish the program/game included?

Will modify code based on their feedback.
